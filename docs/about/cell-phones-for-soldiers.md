# Cell Phones for Soldiers

Computers West sponsors Cell Phones for Soldiers. Each contribution to Cell Phones For Soldiers provides military members with precious talk time through our Minutes That Matter program, and it gives each qualified veteran a cellular device to assist with employment, contacting loved ones and communicating with veteran resources.

[Cell Phones for Soldiers](https://www.cellphonesforsoldiers.com) was started by Brittany and Robbie Bergquist in 2004 when they heard of a soldier having a high phone bill from calling home. What started with raiding their piggy banks has grown into a nationwide cause. Our quest continues.  Continue donating your old phones and pass the word! It’s one way to say Thank You to the men and women who continue to give so much to our country. 

Our Cell Phones for Soldiers box is in the main room by the printer.
