# History of Computers West

Computers West began in **1984** when seven Sun City West residents organized a club to help seniors learn emerging computer technology. Monthly meetings, user groups, and classes quickly followed as membership grew (over 2,700 by 2001).

Through the years, the club:
- Established permanent facilities across Rec Centers, ultimately moving to Palm Ridge.
- Ran free/low‑cost lectures and hands‑on classes (dozens per year).
- Operated a Help Group that has saved members significant repair costs.
- Donated equipment and supported local schools, hospitals, food banks, and programs such as Students Recycling Used Technology (RUT).
- Collected thousands of devices for **Cell Phones for Soldiers** and other community drives.

The club remains true to its purpose: *“Technology Has No Age Limit.”*
